* NOTE: Latest versions of Firefox might not show UnSplash images by default. This can be fixed by typing "about:config" in browser URL bar, scrolling down to parameter "image.avif.enabled" and toggling it to "disabled"

# The mission statement would be "What sets of tools are needed to do what Next13 does for React without using Next13?"


# The base application for a set of Routing and State examples.

## Project uses a port of the Tailwind Vue tutorials to React and Redux as its base application. Redux will be removed where appropriate.

## A work in progress. Basic CRUD is being added.

The plan is to take a modern-looking gui and show how routing and state can be implemented with various tools.
SSR, streaming etc will be added to the various examples once they are reasonably functional

Planned: 
  1) Next13 - directory based routing, SSR, streaming etc
  2) Redux and RTK Query
  3) Redux and react-query
  4) react-router
  5) Redux and Sagas

Planned. Since Vercel has now acquired Svelte, and the latest Sveltekit has directory based routing etc,
the complete Next13 Workcation project will be converted to Sveltekit.
  1) The app with Sveltekit and directory based routing
